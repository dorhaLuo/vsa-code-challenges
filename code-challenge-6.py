# This code challenge is a mirror image of what we did verbally in class with List method. 
# You will repeat the same steps, but with dictionary methods. 

# Pay close attention to the instructions

# Use the following link for any help you need working with the methods
# https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_dictionary.asp

# I also expect you to use "trial and error" to investigate the following questions.

# For each method listed below, do the following:
# indicate any parameters the method takes,
# indicate the return value of the method
# provide an example for use.

# Here is the format I expect to see for each method. There should be a blank line before and after each response.

# methodName()
# INPUT: None/String/Integer/etc. This is what the method RECEIVES. 
# RETURN: None/dict/int/etc
# Your own UNIQUE example of how to use it AND a sentence or two with a real world scenario where such a method would be useful. 
# For example, "The dictionary holds student information for each class, with student names as the key, and information about that student as the value. The last student who enrolled in the class decided to drop the class. I can use popitem() to remove that last enrollment. "
# Your example does not have to be perfect, but it must demonstrate that you are thinking about HOW each method is used.
