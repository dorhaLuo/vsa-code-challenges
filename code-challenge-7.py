# With this challenge we continue working with our data structures. This challenge covers both Tuple and Set methods.

# Pay close attention to the instructions

# Use the following links for any help you need working with the methods
# https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_tuple.asp
# https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_set.asp

# I also expect you to use "trial and error" to investigate the following questions.

# For each method listed below, do the following:
# indicate any parameters the method takes,
# indicate the return value of the method
# provide an example for use.

# Here is the format I expect to see for each method. There should be a blank line before and after each response.

# methodName()
# @params: None/String/Integer/etc. This is what the method RECEIVES.
# @return: None/dict/int/etc
# Your own UNIQUE example of how to use it AND a sentence or two with a real world scenario where such a method would be useful.

############ TUPLES ###############
# https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_tuple.asp

# count()
# @params: any type
# @return: int
# find how many swords we have
weapons = ("arrows","sword","bow","sword","spear","long bow", "sword")
sword_numb = weapons.count("sword")

# index()
# @params: any type (How many? 3?) (what if value not found? exception?)
# @return: int
# find the spear(imagine the weapons are stored in order)
weapons.index("spear")

# Explain why tuples have so few methods compared to lists, dictionaries and sets.
# Because tuples are immutable, you can't do much with them (not much manipulation).

############ SETS ###############
# https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_set.asp

# add()
# @params: any type
# @return: None

# We decide we're going to have a banquet instead of a picnic. We're still going to need fruits
fav_fruits = {"apple", "banana", "cherry","peaches", "watermelon"}
banquet_fruits = fav_fruits.copy()

# discard()
# @params: any type (only 1)
# @return: None
# We want to remove durian just in case somebody sneaked it in(because we discovered Aslan doesn't like durian(sorry Aslan)=)
banquet_fruits.discard("durian")

# pop()
# @params: None
# @return: any type(removed item)
# We don't have enough room for all the fruits, so we need to pop something out.
# We'll pick randomly because we like every fruit and can't decide.
banquet_fruits.pop()

# remove()
